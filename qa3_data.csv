What is supervised machine learning?,"Supervised learning is a type of machine learning in which our algorithms are trained using well-labeled training data, and machines predict the output based on that data. Labeled data indicates that the input data has already been tagged with the appropriate output. Basically, it is the task of learning a function that maps the input set and returns an output. Some of its examples are: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, KNN, etc.",easy
<br/>,## Linear regression,
What is regression? Which models can you use to solve a regression problem?,Regression is a part of supervised ML. Regression models investigate the relationship between a dependent (target) and independent variable (s) (predictor).,easy
Here are some common regression models,- *Linear Regression* establishes a linear relationship between target and predictor (s). It predicts a numeric value and has a shape of a straight line.,
- Lasso Regression penalizes the absolute values of regression coefficients and allows some of the coefficients to reach absolute zero (thereby allowing feature selection).,<br/>,
What is linear regression? When do we use it?,Linear regression is a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (X) and the single output variable (y).,easy
With a simple equation:,```,
```,"B is regression coefficients, x values are the independent (explanatory) variables  and y is dependent variable.",
"The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression. For more than one explanatory variable, the process is called multiple linear regression.",Simple linear regression:,
```,Multiple linear regression:,
```,<br/>,
What are the main assumptions of linear regression?,"There are several assumptions of linear regression. If any of them is violated, model predictions and interpretation may be worthless or misleading.",
"3. Errors are normally distributed, otherwise some features will have more influence on the target variable than to others. If the error distribution is significantly non-normal, confidence intervals may be too wide or too narrow.",<br/>,
What’s the normal distribution? Why do we care about it?,The normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution whose probability density function takes the following formula:,easy
![formula](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/equations/NormalDistribution/NumberedEquation1.gif),where μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation of the distribution.,
"The normal distribution derives its importance from the Central Limit Theorem, which states that if we draw a large enough number of samples, their mean will follow a normal distribution regardless of the initial distribution of the sample, i.e the distribution of the mean of the samples is normal. It is important that each sample is independent from the other.",This is powerful because it helps us study processes whose population distribution is unknown to us.,
How do we check if a variable follows the normal distribution?,"1. Plot a histogram out of the sampled data. If you can fit the bell-shaped ""normal"" curve to the histogram, then the hypothesis that the underlying random variable follows the normal distribution can not be rejected.",medium
4. Check for Quantile-Quantile plot. It is a scatterplot created by plotting two sets of quantiles against one another. Normal Q-Q plot place the data points in a roughly straight line.,<br/>,
What if we want to build a model for predicting prices? Are prices distributed normally? Do we need to do any pre-processing for prices?,"Data is not normal. Specially, real-world datasets or uncleaned datasets always have certain skewness. Same goes for the price prediction. Price of houses or any other thing under consideration depends on a number of factors. So, there's a great chance of presence of some skewed values i.e outliers if we talk in data science terms.",medium
"Yes, you may need to do pre-processing. Most probably, you will need to remove the outliers to make your distribution near-to-normal.",<br/>,
What methods for solving linear regression do you know?,"To solve linear regression, you need to find the coefficients <img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\beta""> which minimize the sum of squared errors.",medium
"Matrix Algebra method: Let's say you have `X`, a matrix of features, and `y`, a vector with the values you want to predict. After going through the matrix algebra and minimization problem, you get this solution: <img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\beta = (X^{T}X)^{-1}X^{T}y"">.","But solving this requires you to find an inverse, which can be time-consuming, if not impossible. Luckily, there are methods like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or QR Decomposition that can reliably calculate this part <img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=(X^{T}X)^{-1}X^{T}""> (called the pseudo-inverse) without actually needing to find an inverse. The popular python ML library `sklearn` uses SVD to solve least squares.",
Alternative method: Gradient Descent. See explanation below.,<br/>,
What is gradient descent? How does it work?,"Gradient descent is an algorithm that uses calculus concept of gradient to try and reach local or global minima. It works by taking the negative of the gradient in a point of a given function, and updating that point repeatedly using the calculated negative gradient, until the algorithm reaches a local or global minimum, which will cause future iterations of the algorithm to return values that are equal or too close to the current point. It is widely used in machine learning applications.",medium
What is the normal equation?,Normal equations are equations obtained by setting equal to zero the partial derivatives of the sum of squared errors (least squares); normal equations allow one to estimate the parameters of a multiple linear regression.,medium
What is SGD  —  stochastic gradient descent? What’s the difference with the usual gradient descent?,"In both gradient descent (GD) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD), you update a set of parameters in an iterative manner to minimize an error function.",medium
"While in GD, you have to run through ALL the samples in your training set to do a single update for a parameter in a particular iteration, in SGD, on the other hand, you use ONLY ONE or SUBSET of training sample from your training set to do the update for a parameter in a particular iteration. If you use SUBSET, it is called Minibatch Stochastic gradient Descent.",<br/>,
Which metrics for evaluating regression models do you know?,1. Mean Squared Error(MSE),easy
5. Adjusted R²,<br/>,
What are MSE and RMSE?,MSE stands for <strong>M</strong>ean <strong>S</strong>quare <strong>E</strong>rror while RMSE stands for <strong>R</strong>oot <strong>M</strong>ean <strong>S</strong>quare <strong>E</strong>rror. They are metrics with which we can evaluate models.,easy
Bias-variance trade-off is a relationship between the expected test error and the variance and the bias - both contribute to the level of the test error and ideally should be as small as possible:,```,
```,"But as a model complexity increases, the bias decreases and the variance increases which leads to *overfitting*. And vice versa, model simplification helps to decrease the variance but it increases the bias which leads to *underfitting*.",
What is overfitting?,"When your model perform very well on your training set but can't generalize the test set, because it adjusted a lot to the training set.",easy
How to validate your models?,"One of the most common approaches is splitting data into train, validation and test parts.",easy
Also you could combine these approaches: make a test/holdout dataset and do cross-validation on the rest of the data. The final quality is measured on test dataset.,<br/>,
"Why do we need to split our data into three parts: train, validation, and test?","The training set is used to fit the model, i.e. to train the model with the data. The validation set is then used to provide an unbiased evaluation of a model while fine-tuning hyperparameters. This improves the generalization of the model. Finally, a test data set which the model has never ""seen"" before should be used for the final evaluation of the model. This allows for an unbiased evaluation of the model. The evaluation should never be performed on the same data that is used for training. Otherwise the model performance would not be representative.",easy
Can you explain how cross-validation works?,"Cross-validation is the process to separate your total training set into two subsets: training and validation set, and evaluate your model to choose the hyperparameters. But you do this process iteratively, selecting different training and validation set, in order to reduce the bias that you would have by selecting only one validation set.",easy
What is K-fold cross-validation?,"K fold cross validation is a method of cross validation where we select a hyperparameter k. The dataset is now divided into k parts. Now, we take the 1st part as validation set and remaining k-1 as training set. Then we take the 2nd part as validation set and remaining k-1 parts as training set. Like this, each part is used as validation set once and the remaining k-1 parts are taken together and used as training set.",easy
It should not be used in a time series data.,<br/>,
How do we choose K in K-fold cross-validation? What’s your favorite K?,"There are two things to consider while deciding K: the number of models we get and the size of validation set. We do not want the number of models to be too less, like 2 or 3. At least 4 models give a less biased decision on the metrics. On the other hand, we would want the dataset to be at least 20-25% of the entire data. So that at least a ratio of 3:1 between training and validation set is maintained. <br/>",easy
I tend to use 4 for small datasets and 5 for large ones as K.,<br/>,
What is classification? Which models would you use to solve a classification problem?,"Classification problems are problems in which our prediction space is discrete, i.e. there is a finite number of values the output variable can be. Some models which can be used to solve classification problems are: logistic regression, decision tree, random forests, multi-layer perceptron, one-vs-all, amongst others.",easy
What is logistic regression? When do we need to use it?,"Logistic regression is a Machine Learning algorithm that is used for binary classification. You should use logistic regression when your Y variable takes only two values, e.g. True and False, ""spam"" and ""not spam"", ""churn"" and ""not churn"" and so on. The variable is said to be a ""binary"" or ""dichotomous"".",easy
Is logistic regression a linear model? Why?,"Yes, Logistic Regression is considered a generalized linear model because the outcome always depends on the sum of the inputs and parameters. Or in other words, the output cannot depend on the product (or quotient, etc.) of its parameters.",easy
What is sigmoid? What does it do?,"A sigmoid function is a type of activation function, and more specifically defined as a squashing function. Squashing functions limit the output to a range between 0 and 1, making these functions useful in the prediction of probabilities.",easy
Sigmod(x) = 1/(1+e^{-x}),<br/>,
How do we evaluate classification models?,"Depending on the classification problem, we can use the following evaluation metrics:",easy
6. Jaccard similarity coefficient score,<br/>,
What is accuracy?,Accuracy is a metric for evaluating classification models. It is calculated by dividing the number of correct predictions by the number of total predictions.,easy
Is accuracy always a good metric?,"Accuracy is not a good performance metric when there is imbalance in the dataset. For example, in binary classification with 95% of A class and 5% of B class, a constant prediction of A class would have an accuracy of 95%. In case of imbalance dataset, we need to choose Precision, recall, or F1 Score depending on the problem we are trying to solve.",easy
What is the confusion table? What are the cells in this table?,"Confusion table (or confusion matrix) shows how many True positives (TP), True Negative (TN), False Positive (FP) and False Negative (FN) model has made.",easy
False Negative (FN): When the actual class of the observation is 1 (True) and the prediction is 0 (False),Most of the performance metrics for classification models are based on the values of the confusion matrix.,
"Max F score is 1 and min is 0, with 1 being the best.",<br/>,
Precision-recall trade-off,Tradeoff means increasing one parameter would lead to decreasing of other. Precision-recall tradeoff occur due to increasing one of the parameter(precision or recall) while keeping the model same.,medium
"In an ideal scenario where there is a perfectly separable data, both precision and recall can get maximum value of 1.0. But in most of the practical situations, there is noise in the dataset and the dataset is not perfectly separable. There might be some points of positive class closer to the negative class and vice versa. In such cases, shifting the decision boundary can either increase the precision or recall but not both. Increasing one parameter leads to decreasing of the other.",<br/>,
What is the ROC curve? When to use it?,ROC stands for *Receiver Operating Characteristics*. The diagrammatic representation that shows the contrast between true positive rate vs false positive rate. It is used when we need to predict the probability of the binary outcome.,medium
What is AUC (AU ROC)? When to use it?,"AUC stands for *Area Under the ROC Curve*. ROC is a probability curve and AUC represents degree or measure of separability. It's used when we need to value how much model is capable of distinguishing between classes.  The value is between 0 and 1, the higher the better.",medium
How to interpret the AU ROC score?,AUC score is the value of *Area Under the ROC Curve*.,medium
"If we assume ROC curve consists of dots, <img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \cdots, (x_m,y_m)"">, then","<img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=AUC = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{m-1}(x_{i%2B1}-x_i)\cdot (y_i%2By_{i%2B1})"">",
"An excellent model has AUC near to the 1 which means it has good measure of separability. A poor model has AUC near to the 0 which means it has worst measure of separability. When AUC score is 0.5, it means model has no class separation capacity whatsoever.",<br/>,
What is the PR (precision-recall) curve?,A *precision*-*recall curve* (or PR Curve) is a plot of the precision (y-axis) and the recall (x-axis) for different probability thresholds. Precision-recall curves (PR curves) are recommended for highly skewed domains where ROC curves may provide an excessively optimistic view of the performance.,medium
What is the area under the PR curve? Is it a useful metric? I,"The Precision-Recall AUC is just like the ROC AUC, in that it summarizes the curve with a range of threshold values as a single score.",medium
"A high area under the curve represents both high recall and high precision, where high precision relates to a low false positive rate, and high recall relates to a low false negative rate.",<br/>,
In which cases AU PR is better than AU ROC?,What is different however is that AU ROC looks at a true positive rate TPR and false positive rate FPR while AU PR looks at positive predictive value PPV and true positive rate TPR.,medium
"Typically, if true negatives are not meaningful to the problem or you care more about the positive class, AU PR is typically going to be more useful; otherwise, If you care equally about the positive and negative class or your dataset is quite balanced, then going with AU ROC is a good idea.",<br/>,
What do we do with categorical variables?,"Categorical variables must be encoded before they can be used as features to train a machine learning model. There are various encoding techniques, including:",medium
- Target encoding,<br/>,
Why do we need one-hot encoding?,"If we simply encode categorical variables with a Label encoder, they become ordinal which can lead to undesirable consequences. In this case, linear models will treat category with id 4 as twice better than a category with id 2. One-hot encoding allows us to represent a categorical variable in a numerical vector space which ensures that vectors of each category have equal distances between each other. This approach is not suited for all situations, because by using it with categorical variables of high cardinality (e.g. customer id) we will encounter problems that come into play because of the curse of dimensionality.",medium
"What is ""curse of dimensionality""?","The curse of dimensionality is an issue that arises when working with high-dimensional data. It is often said that ""the curse of dimensionality"" is one of the main problems with machine learning. The curse of dimensionality refers to the fact that, as the number of dimensions (features) in a data set increases, the number of data points required to accurately learn the relationships between those features increases exponentially.",medium
"A simple example where we have a data set with two features, x1 and x2. If we want to learn the relationship between these two features, we need to have enough data points so that we can accurately estimate the parameters of that relationship. However, if we add a third feature, x3, then the number of data points required to accurately learn the relationships between all three features increases exponentially. This is because there are now more parameters to estimate, and the number of data points needed to accurately estimate those parameters increases exponentially with the number of parameters.","Simply put, the curse of dimensionality basically means that the error increases with the increase in the number of features.",
"What happens to our linear regression model if we have three columns in our data: x, y, z  —  and z is a sum of x and y?","We would not be able to perform the regression. Because z is linearly dependent on x and y so when performing the regression <img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math={X}^{T}{X}""> would be a singular (not invertible) matrix.",medium
What happens to our linear regression model if the column z in the data is a sum of columns x and y and some random noise?,Answer here,medium
What is regularization? Why do we need it?,Regularization is used to reduce overfitting in machine learning models. It helps the models to generalize well and make them robust to outliers and noise in the data.,easy
Which regularization techniques do you know?,"There are mainly two types of regularization,",medium
"Where <img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\lambda""> determines the amount of regularization.",<br/>,
What kind of regularization techniques are applicable to linear models?,"AIC/BIC, Ridge regression, Lasso, Elastic Net, Basis pursuit denoising, Rudin–Osher–Fatemi model (TV), Potts model, RLAD,",medium
"Dantzig Selector,SLOPE",<br/>,
How does L2 regularization look like in a linear model?,L2 regularization adds a penalty term to our cost function which is equal to the sum of squares of models coefficients multiplied by a lambda hyperparameter. This technique makes sure that the coefficients are close to zero and is widely used in cases when we have a lot of features that might correlate with each other.,medium
How do we select the right regularization parameters?,"Regularization parameters can be chosen using a grid search, for example https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html has one formula for the implementing for regularization, alpha in the formula mentioned can be found by doing a RandomSearch or a GridSearch on a set of values and selecting the alpha which gives the least cross validation or validation error.",easy
What’s the effect of L2 regularization on the weights of a linear model?,"L2 regularization penalizes larger weights more severely (due to the squared penalty term), which encourages weight values to decay toward zero.",medium
How L1 regularization looks like in a linear model?,"L1 regularization adds a penalty term to our cost function which is equal to the sum of modules of models coefficients multiplied by a lambda hyperparameter. For example, cost function with L1 regularization will look like: <img src=""https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sum_{i=0}^{N}%20(y_i%20-%20\sum_{j=0}^{M}%20x_{ij}%20*%20w_j)%2B\lambda\sum_{j=0}^{M}%20\left%20|%20w_j%20\right%20|"">",medium
What’s the difference between L2 and L1 regularization?,"- Penalty terms: L1 regularization uses the sum of the absolute values of the weights, while L2 regularization uses the sum of the weights squared.",medium
- Multicollinearity: L2 addresses multicollinearity by constraining the coefficient norm.,<br/>,
Can we have both L1 and L2 regularization components in a linear model?,"Yes, elastic net regularization combines L1 and L2 regularization.",medium
What’s the interpretation of the bias term in linear models?,"Bias is simply, a difference between predicted value and actual/true value. It can be interpreted as the distance from the average prediction and true value i.e. true value minus mean(predictions). But dont get confused between accuracy and bias.",medium
How do we interpret weights in linear models?,"Without normalizing weights or variables, if you increase the corresponding predictor by one unit, the coefficient represents on average how much the output changes. By the way, this interpretation still works for logistic regression - if you increase the corresponding predictor by one unit, the weight represents the change in the log of the odds.",medium
"If the variables are normalized, we can interpret weights in linear models like the importance of this variable in the predicted result.",<br/>,
If a weight for one variable is higher than for another  —  can we say that this variable is more important?,Yes - if your predictor variables are normalized.,medium
"Without normalization, the weight represents the change in the output per unit change in the predictor. If you have a predictor with a huge range and scale that is used to predict an output with a very small range - for example, using each nation's GDP to predict maternal mortality rates - your coefficient should be very small. That does not necessarily mean that this predictor variable is not important compared to the others.",<br/>,
When do we need to perform feature normalization for linear models? When it’s okay not to do it?,Feature normalization is necessary for L1 and L2 regularizations. The idea of both methods is to penalize all the features relatively equally. This can't be done effectively if every feature is scaled differently.,medium
"Linear regression without regularization techniques can be used without feature normalization. Also, regularization can help to make the analytical solution more stable, — it adds the regularization matrix to the feature matrix before inverting it.",<br/>,
What is feature selection? Why do we need it?,Feature Selection is a method used to select the relevant features for the model to train on. We need feature selection to remove the irrelevant features which leads the model to under-perform.,easy
Is feature selection important for linear models?,"Yes, It is. It can make model performance better through selecting the most importance features and remove irrelevant features in order to make a prediction and it can also avoid overfitting, underfitting and bias-variance tradeoff.",medium
Which feature selection techniques do you know?,Here are some of the feature selections:,medium
- ReliefF Algorithm,<br/>,
Can we use L1 regularization for feature selection?,"Yes, because the nature of L1 regularization will lead to sparse coefficients of features. Feature selection can be done by keeping only features with non-zero coefficients.",medium
Can we use L2 regularization for feature selection?,"No, Because L2 regularization does not make the weights zero but only makes them very very small. L2 regularization can be used to solve multicollinearity since it stabilizes the model.",medium
What are the decision trees?,"This is a type of supervised learning algorithm that is mostly used for classification problems. Surprisingly, it works for both categorical and continuous dependent variables.",easy
"In this algorithm, we split the population into two or more homogeneous sets. This is done based on most significant attributes/ independent variables to make as distinct groups as possible.","A decision tree is a flowchart-like tree structure, where each internal node (non-leaf node) denotes a test on an attribute, each branch represents an outcome of the test, and each leaf node (or terminal node) holds a value for the target variable.",
"Various techniques : like Gini, Information Gain, Chi-square, entropy.",<br/>,
How do we train decision trees?,1. Start at the root node.,medium
"3. If a stopping criterion is reached, exit. Otherwise, apply step 2 to each child node in turn.",<br/>,
impurity criterion,<br/>,
How do we handle categorical variables in decision trees?,"Some decision tree algorithms can handle categorical variables out of the box, others cannot. However, we can transform categorical variables, e.g. with a binary or a one-hot encoder.",medium
good explainability,<br/>,
How can we know which features are more important for the decision tree model?,"Often, we want to find a split such that it minimizes the sum of the node impurities. The impurity criterion is a parameter of decision trees. Popular methods to measure the impurity are the Gini impurity and the entropy describing the information gain.",medium
What is random forest?,"Random Forest is a machine learning method for regression and classification which is composed of many decision trees. Random Forest belongs to a larger class of ML algorithms called ensemble methods (in other words, it involves the combination of several models to solve a single prediction problem).",easy
Why do we need randomization in random forest?,"Random forest in an extension of the **bagging** algorithm which takes *random data samples from the training dataset* (with replacement), trains several models and averages predictions. In addition to that, each time a split in a tree is considered, random forest takes a *random sample of m features from full set of n features* (with replacement) and uses this subset of features as candidates for the split (for example, `m = sqrt(n)`).",medium
Training decision trees on random data samples from the training dataset reduces variance. Sampling features for each split in a decision tree decorrelates trees.,<br/>,
What are the main parameters of the random forest model?,- `max_depth`: Longest Path between root node and the leaf,medium
- `max_features`: Limits the maximum number of features provided to trees in random forest model,<br/>,
How do we select the depth of the trees in random forest?,"The greater the depth, the greater amount of information is extracted from the tree, however, there is a limit to this, and the algorithm even if defensive against overfitting may learn complex features of noise present in data and as a result, may overfit on noise. Hence, there is no hard thumb rule in deciding the depth, but literature suggests a few tips on tuning the depth of the tree to prevent overfitting:",medium
- stop developing a node if it does not sufficiently improve the fit.,<br/>,
How do we know how many trees we need in random forest?,"The number of trees in random forest is worked by n_estimators, and a random forest reduces overfitting by increasing the number of trees. There is no fixed thumb rule to decide the number of trees in a random forest, it is rather fine tuned with the data, typically starting off by taking the square of the number of features (n) present in the data followed by tuning until we get the optimal results.",medium
Is it easy to parallelize training of a random forest model? How can we do it?,"Yes, R provides a simple way to parallelize training of random forests on large scale data.",medium
It makes use of a parameter called multicombine which can be set to TRUE for parallelizing random forest computations.,```R,
What are the potential problems with many large trees?,"- Overfitting: A large number of large trees can lead to overfitting, where the model becomes too complex and is able to memorize the training data but doesn't generalize well to new, unseen data.",medium
"- Slow prediction time: As the number of trees in the forest increases, the prediction time for new data points can become quite slow. This can be a problem when you need to make predictions in real-time or on a large dataset.","- Memory consumption: Random Forest models with many large trees can consume a lot of memory, which can be a problem when working with large datasets or on a limited hardware.",
"- Lack of interpretability: Random Forest models with many large trees can be difficult to interpret, making it harder to understand how the model is making predictions or what features are most important.",- Difficulty in tuning : With an increasing number of large trees the tuning process becomes more complex and computationally expensive.,
"It's important to keep in mind that the number of trees in a Random Forest should be chosen based on the specific problem and dataset, rather than using a large number of trees by default. In practice, the number of trees in a random forest is chosen based on the trade-off between the computational cost and the performance.",<br/>,
"What if instead of finding the best split, we randomly select a few splits and just select the best from them. Will it work?",Answer here,expert
What happens when we have correlated features in our data?,"In random forest, since random forest samples some features to build each tree, the information contained in correlated features is twice as much likely to be picked than any other information contained in other features.",medium
"In general, when you are adding correlated features, it means that they linearly contains the same information and thus it will reduce the robustness of your model. Each time you train your model, your model might pick one feature or the other to ""do the same job"" i.e. explain some variance, reduce entropy, etc.",<br/>,
What is gradient boosting trees?,"Gradient boosting is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees.",medium
What’s the difference between random forest and gradient boosting?,1. Random Forests builds each tree independently while Gradient Boosting builds one tree at a time.,medium
"2. Random Forests combine results at the end of the process (by averaging or ""majority rules"") while Gradient Boosting combines     results along the way.",<br/>,
Is it possible to parallelize training of a gradient boosting model? How to do it?,"Yes, different frameworks provide different options to make training faster, using GPUs to speed up the process by making it highly parallelizable.For example, for XGBoost <i>tree_method = 'gpu_hist'</i> option makes training faster by use of GPUs.",medium
Feature importance in gradient boosting trees  —  what are possible options?,Answer here,medium
Are there any differences between continuous and discrete variables when it comes to feature importance of gradient boosting models?,Answer here,expert
What are the main parameters in the gradient boosting model?,"There are many parameters, but below are a few key defaults.",medium
subsample=1.0.,<br/>,
How do you approach tuning parameters in XGBoost or LightGBM?,"Depending upon the dataset, parameter tuning can be done manually or using hyperparameter optimization frameworks such as optuna and hyperopt. In manual parameter tuning, we need to be aware of max-depth, min_samples_leaf and min_samples_split so that our model does not overfit the data but try to predict generalized characteristics of data (basically keeping variance and bias low for our model).",expert
How do you select the number of trees in the gradient boosting model?,"Most implementations of gradient boosting are configured by default with a relatively small number of trees, such as hundreds or thousands. Using scikit-learn we can perform a grid search of the n_estimators model parameter",medium
Which hyper-parameter tuning strategies (in general) do you know?,There are several strategies for hyper-tuning but I would argue that the three most popular nowadays are the following:,medium
What’s the difference between grid search parameter tuning strategy and random search? When to use one or another?,"For specifics, refer to the above answer.",medium
What kind of problems neural nets can solve?,"Neural nets are good at solving non-linear problems. Some good examples are problems that are relatively easy for humans (because of experience, intuition, understanding, etc), but difficult for traditional regression models: speech recognition, handwriting recognition, image identification, etc.",easy
How does a usual fully-connected feed-forward neural network work?,"In a usual fully-connected feed-forward network, each neuron receives input from every element of the previous layer and thus the receptive field of a neuron is the entire previous layer. They are usually used to represent feature vectors for input data in classification problems but can be expensive to train because of the number of computations involved.",medium
Why do we need activation functions?,"The main idea of using neural networks is to learn complex nonlinear functions. If we are not using an activation function in between different layers of a neural network, we are just stacking up multiple linear layers one on top of another and this leads to learning a linear function. The Nonlinearity comes only with the activation function, this is the reason we need activation functions.",easy
What are the problems with sigmoid as an activation function?,The derivative of the sigmoid function for large positive or negative numbers is almost zero. From this comes the problem of vanishing gradient — during the backpropagation our net will not learn (or will learn drastically slow). One possible way to solve this problem is to use ReLU activation function.,medium
What is ReLU? How is it better than sigmoid or tanh?,"ReLU is an abbreviation for Rectified Linear Unit. It is an activation function which has the value 0 for all negative values and the value f(x) = x for all positive values. The ReLU has a simple activation function which makes it fast to compute and while the sigmoid and tanh activation functions saturate at higher values, the ReLU has a potentially infinite activation, which addresses the problem of vanishing gradients.",medium
How we can initialize the weights of a neural network?,Proper initialization of weight matrix in neural network is very necessary.,medium
What if we set all the weights of a neural network to 0?,"If all the weights of a neural network are set to zero, the output of each connection is same (W*x = 0). This means the gradients which are backpropagated to each connection in a layer is same. This means all the connections/weights learn the same thing, and the model never converges.",medium
What is dropout? Why is it useful? How does it work?,"Dropout is a technique that at each training step turns off each neuron with a certain probability of *p*. This way at each iteration we train only *1-p* of neurons, which forces the network not to rely only on the subset of neurons for feature representation. This leads to regularizing effects that are controlled by the hyperparameter *p*.",medium
What is backpropagation? How does it work? Why do we need it?,The Backpropagation algorithm looks for the minimum value of the error function in weight space using a technique called the delta rule or gradient descent.,medium
The weights that minimize the error function is then considered to be a solution to the learning problem.,"We need backpropogation because,",
"Model is ready to make a prediction – Once the error becomes minimum, you can feed some inputs to your model and it will produce the output.",<br/>,
"Adam(best one. less time, more efficient)",<br/>,
How do we use SGD (stochastic gradient descent) for training a neural net?,"SGD approximates the expectation with few randomly selected samples (instead of the full data). In comparison to batch gradient descent, we can efficiently approximate the expectation in large data sets using SGD. For neural networks this reduces the training time a lot even considering that it will converge later as the random sampling adds noise to the gradient descent.",medium
What’s the learning rate?,"The learning rate is an important hyperparameter that controls how quickly the model is adapted to the problem during the training. It can be seen as the ""step width"" during the parameter updates, i.e. how far the weights are moved into the direction of the minimum of our optimization problem.",easy
What happens when the learning rate is too large? Too small?,"A large learning rate can accelerate the training. However, it is possible that we ""shoot"" too far and miss the minimum of the function that we want to optimize, which will not result in the best solution. On the other hand, training with a small learning rate takes more time but it is possible to find a more precise minimum. The downside can be that the solution is stuck in a local minimum, and the weights won't update even if it is not the best possible global solution.",easy
How to set the learning rate?,There is no straightforward way of finding an optimum learning rate for a model. It involves a lot of hit and trial. Usually starting with a small values such as 0.01 is a good starting point for setting a learning rate and further tweaking it so that it doesn't overshoot or converge too slowly.,medium
What is Adam? What’s the main difference between Adam and SGD?,"Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) is a optimization technique for training neural networks. on an average, it is the best optimizer .It works with momentums of first and second order. The intuition behind the Adam is that we don’t want to roll so fast just because we can jump over the minimum, we want to decrease the velocity a little bit for a careful search.",medium
SGD's high variance disadvantages gets rectified by Adam (as advantage for Adam).,<br/>,
When would you use Adam and when SGD?,"Adam tends to converge faster, while SGD often converges to more optimal solutions.",medium
Do we want to have a constant learning rate or we better change it throughout training?,"Generally, it is recommended to start learning rate with relatively high value and then gradually decrease learning rate so the model does not overshoot the minima and at the same time we don't want to start with very low learning rate as the model will take too long to converge. There are many available techniques to do decay the learning rate. For example, in PyTorch you can use",medium
a function called StepLR which decays the learning rate of each parameter by value gamma-which we have to pass through argument- after n number of epoch which you can also set through function argument named epoch_size.,<br/>,
How do we decide when to stop training a neural net?,Simply stop training when the validation error is the minimum.,easy
What is model checkpointing?,Saving the weights learned by a model mid training for long running processes is known as model checkpointing so that you can resume your training from a certain checkpoint.,medium
Can you tell us how you approach the model training process?,Answer here,medium
How we can use neural nets for computer vision?,Neural nets used in the area of computer vision are generally Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN's). You can learn about convolutions below. It appears that convolutions are quite powerful when it comes to working with images and videos due to their ability to extract and learn complex features. Thus CNN's are a go-to method for any problem in computer vision.,medium
What’s a convolutional layer?,"The idea of the convolutional layer is the assumption that the information needed for making a decision often is spatially close and thus, it only takes the weighted sum over nearby inputs. It also assumes that the networks’ kernels can be reused for all nodes, hence the number of weights can be drastically reduced. To counteract only one feature being learnt per layer, multiple kernels are applied to the input which creates parallel channels in the output. Consecutive layers can also be stacked to allow the network to find more high-level features.",medium
Why do we actually need convolutions? Can’t we use fully-connected layers for that?,"A fully-connected layer needs one weight per inter-layer connection, which means the number of weights which needs to be computed quickly balloons as the number of layers and nodes per layer is increased.",medium
What’s pooling in CNN? Why do we need it?,"Pooling is a technique to downsample the feature map. It allows layers which receive relatively undistorted versions of the input to learn low level features such as lines, while layers deeper in the model can learn more abstract features such as texture.",medium
How does max pooling work? Are there other pooling techniques?,"Max pooling is a technique where the maximum value of a receptive field is passed on in the next feature map. The most commonly used receptive field is 2 x 2 with a stride of 2, which means the feature map is downsampled from N x N to N/2 x N/2. Receptive fields larger than 3 x 3 are rarely employed as too much information is lost.",medium
"Global pooling, where the receptive field is set to be equal to the input size, this means the output is equal to a scalar and can be used to reduce the dimensionality of the feature map.",<br/>,
Are CNNs resistant to rotations? What happens to the predictions of a CNN if an image is rotated?,"CNNs are not resistant to rotation by design. However, we can make our models resistant by augmenting our datasets with different rotations of the raw data. The predictions of a CNN will change if an image is rotated and we did not augment our dataset accordingly. A demonstration of this occurence can be seen in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO1bQo4PXV4), where a CNN changes its predicted class between a duck and a rabbit based on the rotation of the image.",expert
What are augmentations? Why do we need them?,"Augmentations are an artifical way of expanding the existing datasets by performing some transformations, color shifts or many other things on the data. It helps in diversifying the data and even increasing the data when there is scarcity of data for a model to train on.",easy
What kind of augmentations do you know?,"There are many kinds of augmentations which can be used according to the type of data you are working on some of which are geometric and numerical transformation, PCA, cropping, padding, shifting, noise injection etc.",easy
How to choose which augmentations to use?,"Augmentations really depend on the type of output classes and the features you want your model to learn. For eg. if you have mostly properly illuminated images in your dataset and want your model to predict poorly illuminated images too, you can apply channel shifting on your data and include the resultant images in your dataset for better results.",medium
What kind of CNN architectures for classification do you know?,Image Classification,expert
MobileNet,The last three are designed so they use smaller number of parameters which is helpful for edge AI.,
What is transfer learning? How does it work?,"Given a source domain D_S and learning task T_S, a target domain D_T and learning task T_T, transfer learning aims to help improve the learning of the target predictive function f_T in D_T using the knowledge in D_S and T_S, where D_S ≠ D_T,or T_S ≠ T_T. In other words, transfer learning enables to reuse knowledge coming from other domains or learning tasks.",medium
"In the context of CNNs, we can use networks that were pre-trained on popular datasets such as ImageNet. We then can use the weights of the layers that learn to represent features and combine them with a new set of layers that learns to map the feature representations to the given classes. Two popular strategies are either to freeze the layers that learn the feature representations completely, or to give them a smaller learning rate.",<br/>,

How can we use machine learning for text classification?,"Machine learning classification algorithms predict a class based on a numerical feature representation. This means that in order to use machine learning for text classification, we need to extract numerical features from our text data first before we can apply machine learning algorithms. Common approaches to extract numerical features from text data are bag of words, N-grams or word embeddings.",medium
What is bag of words? How we can use it for text classification?,"Bag of Words is a representation of text that describes the occurrence of words within a document. The order or structure of the words is not considered. For text classification, we look at the histogram of the words within the text and consider each word count as a feature.",medium
What are the advantages and disadvantages of bag of words?,Advantages:,medium
1. Simple to understand and implement.,Disadvantages:,
"3. Discarding word order ignores the context, and in turn meaning of words in the document. Context and meaning can offer a lot to the model, that if modeled could tell the difference between the same words differently arranged (“this is interesting” vs “is this interesting”), synonyms (“old bike” vs “used bike”).",<br/>,
What are N-grams? How can we use them?,The function to tokenize into consecutive sequences of words is called n-grams. It can be used to find out N most co-occurring words (how often word X is followed by word Y) in a given sentence.,medium
How large should be N for our bag of words when using N-grams?,Answer here,medium
What is TF-IDF? How is it useful for text classification?,"Term Frequency (TF) is a scoring of the frequency of the word in the current document. Inverse Document Frequency(IDF) is a scoring of how rare the word is across documents. It is used in scenario where highly recurring words may not contain as much informational content as the domain specific words. For example, words like “the” that are frequent across all documents therefore need to be less weighted. The TF-IDF score highlights words that are distinct (contain useful information) in a given document.",medium
Which model would you use for text classification with bag of words features?,1. Bag Of Words model,medium
6. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT),<br/>,
Would you prefer gradient boosting trees model or logistic regression when doing text classification with bag of words?,Usually logistic regression is better because bag of words creates a matrix with large number of columns. For a huge number of columns logistic regression is usually faster than gradient boosting trees.,medium
What are word embeddings? Why are they useful? Do you know Word2Vec?,"Word Embeddings are vector representations for words. Each word is mapped to one vector, this vector tries to capture some characteristics of the word, allowing similar words to have similar vector representations.",medium
Word Embeddings helps in capturing the inter-word semantics and represents it in real-valued vectors.,<br/>,
Word2Vec is a method to construct such an embedding. It takes a text corpus as input and outputs a set of vectors which represents words in that corpus.,It can be generated using two methods:,
- Skip-Gram,<br/>,

"p_j is a directly density-reachable point of the neighborhood of p_i if dist(p_i,p_j) <= epsilon.",<br/>,
"K-means has a lower complexity, i.e. it will be much faster, especially with a larger amount of points.",<br/>,
What is the curse of dimensionality? Why do we care about it?,"Data in only one dimension is relatively tightly packed. Adding a dimension stretches the points across that dimension, pushing them further apart. Additional dimensions spread the data even further making high dimensional data extremely sparse. We care about it, because it is difficult to use machine learning in sparse spaces.",medium
Fourier and Wavelet Transforms,<br/>,
"Having calculated the eigenvectors and eigenvalues, we can use the Kaiser-Guttman criterion, a scree plot or the proportion of explained variance to determine the principal components (i.e. the final dimensionality) that are useful for dimensionality reduction.",<br/>,

How would you evaluate your ranking algorithms? Which offline metrics would you use?,Answer here,medium
What is precision and recall at k?,Precision at k and recall at k are evaluation metrics for ranking algorithms. Precision at k shows the share of relevant items in the first *k* results of the ranking algorithm. And Recall at k indicates the share of relevant items returned in top *k* results out of all correct answers for a given query.,medium

What is a recommender system?,Recommender systems are software tools and techniques that provide suggestions for items that are most likely of interest to a particular user.,easy
A user should explore new items.,<br/>,
"Collaborative filtering does only need a rating matrix as input and improves over time. However, it does not work well on sparse data, does not work for cold starts (see below) and usually tends to overfit.",<br/>,
"How we can incorporate implicit feedback (clicks, etc) into our recommender systems?","In comparison to explicit feedback, implicit feedback datasets lack negative examples. For example, explicit feedback can be a positive or a negative rating, but implicit feedback may be the number of purchases or clicks. One popular approach to solve this problem is named weighted alternating least squares (wALS) [Hu, Y., Koren, Y., & Volinsky, C. (2008, December). Collaborative filtering for implicit feedback datasets. In Data Mining, 2008. ICDM'08. Eighth IEEE International Conference on (pp. 263-272). IEEE.]. Instead of modeling the rating matrix directly, the numbers (e.g. amount of clicks) describe the strength in observations of user actions. The model tries to find latent factors that can be used to predict the expected preference of a user for an item.",medium
What is the cold start problem?,"Collaborative filterung incorporates crowd knowledge to give recommendations for certain items. Say we want to recommend how much a user will like an item, we then will calculate the score using the recommendations of other users for this certain item. We can distinguish between two different ways of a cold start problem now. First, if there is a new item that has not been rated yet, we cannot give any recommendation. Also, when there is a new user, we cannot calculate a similarity to any other user.",medium
Demographic filtering incorporates user profiles to calculate a similarity between them and solves the cold start problem for new users.,<br/>,
What is a time series?,A time series is a set of observations ordered in time usually collected at regular intervals.,easy
How is time series different from the usual regression problem?,"The principle behind causal forecasting is that the value that has to be predicted is dependant on the input features (causal factors). In time series forecasting, the to be predicted value is expected to follow a certain pattern over time.",easy
"Deep learning approaches (RNN, LSTM, etc.)",<br/>,
"If there’s a trend in our series, how we can remove it? And why would we want to do it?","We can explicitly model the trend (and/or seasonality) with approaches such as Holt's Method or Holt-Winter's Method. We want to explicitly model the trend to reach the stationarity property for the data. Many time series approaches require stationarity. Without stationarity,the interpretation of the results of these analyses is problematic [Manuca, Radu & Savit, Robert. (1996). Stationarity and nonstationarity in time series analysis. Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena. 99. 134-161. 10.1016/S0167-2789(96)00139-X. ].",medium
You have a series with only one variable “y” measured at time t. How do predict “y” at time t+1? Which approaches would you use?,We want to look at the correlation between different observations of y. This measure of correlation is called autocorrelation. Autoregressive models are multiple regression models where the time-lag series of the original time series are treated like multiple independent variables.,medium
You have a series with a variable “y” and a set of features. How do you predict “y” at t+1? Which approaches would you use?,"Given the assumption that the set of features gives a meaningful causation to y, a causal forecasting approach such as linear regression or multiple nonlinear regression might be useful. In case there is a lot of data and the explainability of the results is not a high priority, we can also consider deep learning approaches.",medium
What are the problems with using trees for solving time series problems?,Random Forest models are not able to extrapolate time series data and understand increasing/decreasing trends. It will provide us with average data points if the validation data has values greater than the training data points.,medium
